## Project details
This repository holds code files and presentation documents for a project conducting through a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates. The research focuses on dynamic modeling of stream metabolism derived from dissolved oxygen and dissolved carbon levels. The main goal of the project was to understand the influence of stoichiometric coefficients on stream metabolism and worked with real data from the Upper Clarkfork River in Montana, USA. The files for this project include three sensitivity analysis files as well as the abstract and poster for the presentation of the research at the Society of Freshwater Sciences 2021 Conference. A full project summary & report can be found in the main repository branch. 
## Motivation & Methods
There are many methods to measure and further model stream metabolism. However, these models typically rely on dissolve oxygen levels and do not consider dissolved carbon concentrations in the stream. The goal for this project was to improve previous modeling efforts and better understand how stoichiometry affects concentrations of dissolved gasses in streams & metabolism measurements.
